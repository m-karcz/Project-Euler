My programs which I used to solve ProjectEuler problems.

I guess only easy problems will be solved.

### Done so far:
for n in range(1,43):
  - Problem n

and:
- Problem 45 - Triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal
- Problem 46 - Goldbach's other conjecture
- Problem 48 - Self powers
- Problem 50 - Consecutive prime sum
- Problem 52 - Permuted multiplies
- Problem 67 - Maximum path sum II
- Problem 76 - Counting summations
- Problem 81 - Path sum: two ways
- Problem 82 - Path sum: three ways
- Problem 83 - Path sum: four ways
- Problem 92 - Square digit chains
- Problem 99 - Largest exponential
- Problem 206 - Concealed square
