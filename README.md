- Problem 1 - Multiplies of 3 and 5
- Problem 3 - Largest prime factor
- Problem 6 - Sum square difference
- Problem 7 - 10001st prime
- Problem 15 - Lattice paths
- Problem 16 - Power digit sum
- Problem 18 - Maximum path sum I
- Problem 31 - Coin sums
- Problem 39 - Integer right triangles
- Problem 67 - Maximum path sum II
- Problem 76 - Counting summations
- Problem 81 - Path sum: two ways
- Problem 82 - Path sum: three ways
