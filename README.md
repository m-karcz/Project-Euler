# ProjectEuler

My programs which I used to solve ProjectEuler problems.

I guess only easy problems will be solved.

### Done so far:

- Problem 1 - Multiplies of 3 and 5
- Problem 7 - 10001st prime
- Problem 18 - Maximum path sum I
- Problem 31 - Coin sums
- Problem 39 - Integer right triangles
- Problem 67 - Maximum path sum II
